<h1>Introduction and Welcome</h1>
<p>
Welcome to the Proof of Concept (PoC) for NHS Englandâ€™s Value Set Management Tool (VSMT). 
</p>
<h2>
Scope
</h2>
<p>
The current PoC is limited to allowing a user to upload a value set, and for the VSMT to provide an outcome report, based on a range of 13 pre-defined Set Checks. 
Different Set Checks run depending on whether the value set is being used for data entry or data extraction purposes, and whether the user wishes to check the value set against a single SNOMED release or between two SNOMED releases.  
</p>
<h2>
Limitations
</h2>
<p>
The PoC is developed for use in Health & Care settings within the UK, and therefore makes use of published SNOMED CT UK Edition only. The inclusion of any SNOMED Components that are not within the SNOMED CT UK Edition in your value set may prevent the full suite of Set Checks being completed.
</p>
<p>
The PoC does not prevent users from loading large files but uploading large files (in excess of 2,000) may impact the performance of the tool.  
</p>
<h2>
Licencing
</h2>
<p>
By using the PoC, you accept the licence agreement for the use of SNOMED CT (a link to the agreement is provided here).
</p>
<h2>
Cookies
</h2>
<p>
The PoC operates with only essential cookies. By using the PoC, you accept the use of these essential cookies.
